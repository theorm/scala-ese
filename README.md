# Encryped Content-Encoding for HTTP

Scala version of [https://github.com/martinthomson/encrypted-content-encoding](https://github.com/martinthomson/encrypted-content-encoding) which is based on [https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-http-encryption-encoding-00](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-http-encryption-encoding-00).

## Tasks

Scala REPL
----------

The `console` and `consoleQuick` sbt tasks start the Scala REPL with a few commonly used imports such as `JavaConverters`, `collection.mutable`, `Future`, `Random`, `Try` and `NonFatal` already in scope.

The REPL also defines a `desugar` macro, that expands an expression to its desugared form and inferred type. Try, for instance `desugar(1 to 3)`.

Scalastyle
----------

The `scalastyle` and `test:scalastyle` sbt tasks are used to check source and test code with Scalastyle.
The error list is saved to Checkstyle-compatible files `target/scalastyle-result.xml` and `target/scalastyle-test-result.xml` respectively.

Scalastyle runs automatically against source and test code with the sbt `test` task.

It is not recommended to make the `compile` task dependent on Scalastyle.
Since Scalastyle runs first and fails if the code does not compile, one would not get the Scala compiler error messages.

scoverage
---------

To execute tests with code coverage enabled run the following sbt tasks: `clean` `coverage` `test` `coverageReport`.
Coverage reports are saved to `target/scala-2.11/scoverage-report/`.

The `coverage` command is sticky. To turn it off, use `coverageOff`.

Scalariform
-----------

To format source and test code run the `scalariformFormat` and `test:scalariformFormat` sbt tasks.

Scalariform is provided as a convenience and starting point; it is not sufficient to be fully compliant with the Scala Style Guide.

sbt-updates
-----------

There is a `dependencyUpdates` sbt task to check Maven repositories for dependency updates.

sbt-dependency-graph
--------------------

This plugin adds three main tasks: `dependency-tree` displays the project dependencies as a tree, `dependency-graph` shows it as a graph, and `what-depends-on <organization> <module> <revision>` shows everything that depends on an artifact.

sbt-stats
---------

The `stats` sbt task shows basic line counting statistics.

sbteclipse
----------

Uncomment the related line in `project/plugins.sbt` to enable the `eclipse` sbt task to create Eclipse project definitions.
